naive.cpp: 
i,j,k loops where Cij = sum over k Aik * Bkj (source: Wikipedia)
This is column-major (bad). Lots of cache misses. Performance limited by memory access.

order.cpp:
i,k,j loops. Loops are in a different order.
This is row-major (good). Drastically reduces the number of cache misses and improve performance by an order of magnitude.

threads.cpp:
Adding OpenMP directives for threading.

target.cpp:
Adding OpenMP directives for OpenMP target (GPU) Offloading.

cuda.cu:
Needs to be compiled with nvcc. Uses CUDA to run the code on a GPU.

run.sh:
runs the different versions to generate execution time data.

plot.sh:
plot the execution times generated with run.sh.
