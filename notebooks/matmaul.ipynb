The first plot shows the execution time (how long it took to execute the matrix-multiplication in seconds) for different matrix sizes from 64x64 to 2048x2048. As you can see, it took a lot longer for the CPU to compute the largest matrix-sizes. The GPU was always able to finish the computation in under 2 seconds!\n","\n"," **Second plot:** This exactly the same thing, but now on a logarithmic scale for the y axis. The logarithmic scale is useful when comparing very different numbers! Indeed, now it is clear that even though the GPU is always fast, it also needs more time to compute larger matrix sizes. In fact, this plot shows that the GPU is about 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (10x-100x) faster than the CPU for this task! \n","\n","**Third plot:** This is the ratio CPU_TIME / GPU_TIME. This is exactly how much faster the GPU is compared to the CPU. It shows that not only the GPU is much faster than the CPU, it is also more efficient with largest matrix sizes! One reason for this is simple: you need a fixed time to send the data to/from the GPU, which scales linearly O(n). However, the amount of computations scales as O(n^3). Simply put: with largest matrix sizes, we spend more time doing computation and less time copying data, which result in a more efficient use of our time, which makes the GPU even better than the CPU for this task!\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_fLzHmV6Vc9V"},"source":["## Further optimizations: using shared memory\n","\n","Below we define a block matrix-matrix multiplication algorithm to help reduce the number of accesses to the global GPU memory.
